**Capstone Project:**  
Predict whether a patient would receive a metastatic TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) diagnosis within 90 days of screening, using demographic, clinical, insurance, and environmental data

### üîç Project Highlights

- Performed comprehensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to:
  - Identify data quality issues
  - Address class imbalance
  - Explore correlations and variable distributions

- Applied **feature engineering** techniques:
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Imputation of missing values
  - Feature scaling
  - Aggregation at the ZIP code level

- Developed and compared multiple **binary classification models**:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Logistic Regression
  - Gradient Boosting

- Evaluated models using:
  - **Accuracy, Recall, ROC-AUC**
  - Special focus on **fairness** and **class imbalance mitigation**
